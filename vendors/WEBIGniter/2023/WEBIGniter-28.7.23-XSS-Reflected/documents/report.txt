## Title: WEBIGniter-28.7.23-XSS-Reflected 
## Author: nu11secur1ty
## Date: 09/04/2023
## Vendor: https://webigniter.net/
## Software: https://webigniter.net/demo
## Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting


## Description:
The value of the redirect request parameter is copied into the value of an HTML tag attribute which is encapsulated in double quotation marks. The payload ycsz3"><script>alert(1)</script>bn76w was submitted in the redirect parameter. This input was echoed unmodified in the application's response.
By using this Java Script injection, the attacker can trick a lot of users into visiting his dangerous URL which is reflected on the login form, before they log in, warning them that there is a problem with the login, which is very nasty and DANGEROUS!

## Staus: HIGH Vulnerability
