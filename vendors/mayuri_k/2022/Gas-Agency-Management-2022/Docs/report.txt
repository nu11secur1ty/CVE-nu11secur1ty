## Description:
The Gas Agency Management-2022 by Mayuri K suffers from multiple vulnerabilities, which means this project must be deprecated immediately!

1. - SQLi: the parameter username is vulnerable to time-based blind (query SLEEP) injection - not sanitizing well.
2. - Unauthenticated file upload - not sanitizing upload function - possible to upload .php extension files on photo section, for the customers.
3. - XSS-reflected in the section adds customer in address function.
4. - Web shell file upload - unauthenticated extension file upload, in this case, is PHP web shell uploader. After this, the malicious user can execute the already   uploaded file remotely, and he can destroy completely this flawed system.
5. - STATUS: For termination of the project.
